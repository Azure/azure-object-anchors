# Azure Object Anchors

Welcome to Azure Object Anchors. Azure Object Anchors enables an application to detect an object in the physical world using a 3D model and estimate its 6-DoF pose. The SDK enables a HoloLens application to load an object model, detect, and track instance(s) of that model in the physical world. For more information, see the [Azure Object Anchors documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/object-anchors).
